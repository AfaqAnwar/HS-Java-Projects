# Chatbot

Jarvis is an event chatbot designed to find events around New York City based on a specific interest.

## Notes

Jarvis uses jsoup, a web scraping library built for Java. 

The website used to query events, Eventbrite, may undergo changes in the future resulting in a need to change
the website and query used, along with the selected elements from said website.
