#Survive The Night
A text based survival / adventure game where you must survive for "8 hours" by exploring the forest, finding, saving, and using various items along your path. 

##Notes

This was the first project that required extensive Object Oriented Programming, although it's not perfect I'm really proud of this one.
I spent a decent amount of time on it, and was able to create something enjoyable and playable.
