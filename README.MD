# High School Java Projects

This repository contains all of my Java projects while studying at Brooklyn Technical High School.

Projects are both text, and UI based. Interfaces were developed using JavaFX.

As of Oracle SDK 11, JavaFX is no longer bound to the JDK. 
As a result the alternative is running OpenJFX11+, which can be found [here](https://openjfx.io/).

Additionally running any of the JavaFX projects using a JDK bundled with JavaFX is also fine.

All other necessary libraries are included.

I had an amazing time while working on all of these projects.
